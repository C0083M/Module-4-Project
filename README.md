Module 4 Repository

A. Challenges that I ran into include:
- I created an error with the vercel dev command which required me to uninstall and reinstall vercel CLI commands
- At one point my site would simply download the index.py file to my system when being opened.
- Error 501, Server wasnt allowing get requests. fixed with server call function (Serverless Function).
- I mistakenly wrote "requirements" inside the requirements.txt file instead of "requests".

B. Vercel requires a server function when running the type of code I wrote. I couldn't find a reason as to why.
C. Improve formatting, Add other fields such as location and ISP.
D. Program is getting the Vercel server IP rather then our home router IP
